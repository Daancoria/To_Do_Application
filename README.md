In this project, I built a functional To-Do List Application using Python from scratch.
This assignment helped me strengthen my understanding of Python concepts.
The UI is pretty self explanatory:

The program will open with a prompt where it asks the user if they want to add, remove, see tasks or if they just want to close 
the project. 
It will number the options from 1-4, and then it will give prompts on how to proceed. 
At the end of every task, you will get a message saying wether the task was added succesfully or if there was an error with the input.
